// 1.d. Write a function called `longestIncreasingSubsequence` that takes an array
//  of numbers as input and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array.
//   A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence
//  by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
